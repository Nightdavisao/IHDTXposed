# I Hate Dark Theme (acronym IHDT)
A Xposed module that stops the battery saver from activating dark theme
## Why?
Because dark theme doesn't actually save battery if your device's display doesn't turn off pixels.
## Install
Check [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Nightdavisao/IHDTXposed/releases). After installing it, you must reboot your device.
